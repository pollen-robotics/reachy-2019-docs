From your Raspberry-Pi board, you can find in the folder ~/dev/reachy-tictactoe.
Inside, you will find:
the code implementing the gameplay mechanisms, the specific assets: move trajectories, pre-trained vision network a service file to simplify launching Launch the demo at boot The easiest way to setup the demo is to launch it automatically at startup.</description></item><item><title>Playing With Reachy</title><link>https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2019-docs/docs/tictactoe/playing-with-reachy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2019-docs/docs/tictactoe/playing-with-reachy/</guid><description>Playing with Reachy Unwrapping the demo Controlling the demo As you can see on the diagram, the demo runs in a fully autonomous way. Yet, they are a few way you can control and interact with it.
First, the robot will start a game only once the board is cleared. It is up to you to reset the board position and to put back the pawn to their base positions.</description></item><item><title>Train Your Own Vision Detection</title><link>https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2019-docs/docs/tictactoe/train-your-own-detection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2019-docs/docs/tictactoe/train-your-own-detection/</guid><description>Train your own vision detection Take pictures of the board board, img = tp.reachy.analyze_board() Organize and get your data ready Train your classifier Use your own trained versions</description></item></channel></rss>
